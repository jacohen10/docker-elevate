For project 2 my app will be an interface for restaurants and customers. Customers will be able to add meals to their meal plan and restaurants will be able to deduct meals when customers come in.

Technologies used:
Devise gem: This helped with user registration and made it easy for users to sign in and out.
CanCan gem: CanCan made it easier to limit the authorizations of users with specific roles.
Bootstrap: Bootstrap allowed me to easily give my web app some basic styling.


Approach taken: After I made my ERD I followed that and my wireframes to get started. Once I finished my original objectives though, I had to make some adjustments to my app. Now that I have the experience of making a more fleshed out app, I'll be able to more fully plan out future apps that I make.

Installation instructions:
If you sign up regularly you'll be assigned the customer role and won't have access to the rest of the web app. Sign in as an Admin with username: testing@gmail.com and password: testing123

Unsolved problems: I'd like to create a separate sign up link for restaurants. I ran out of time to do this and need to read up more on Devise.
